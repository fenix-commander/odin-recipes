            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Start by making the sauce</b> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions,
                and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
                The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</b> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>    
            <li><b>From there, it's just an assembly job.</b> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>    
            <li><b>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</b></li>
        </ol>
